# Powerpoint AI ChatBot - Frontend

## Description
This project is a **PowerPoint Context Add-in** built with **React** and **Office.js** to manage and search slides. The add-in allows users to open a popup window, search for slides, and add them to a deck.

The application focuses on two key functionalities:

1. **Slide Selection Popup**: üñºÔ∏è An intuitive interface that allows users to browse and select from previously created slides seamlessly.
2. **Instruction Form**: ‚úçÔ∏è A user-friendly text input form where users can provide instructions to transform their ideas into concrete PowerPoint actions, enabling efficient and automated slide generation.

5. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will run on:
   ```
   https://localhost:3000
   ```

6. **Trust the Self-Signed Certificate**:

   - Open https://localhost:3000 in your browser.
   - Accept the self-signed certificate.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. **Enable HTTPS** for your local development server as described above.
2. Open PowerPoint and load the manifest file (`manifest.xml`) to add the custom task pane add-in.
3. Interact with the chatbot using the slide selection popup or the instruction form.

## PowerPoint Configuration
### Load the Add-in in PowerPoint

1. **Insert the Add-in in PowerPoint**:
   - Open PowerPoint.
   - Go to Insert > My Add-ins > Upload My Add-in.
   - Select the manifest.xml file.

2. **Verify the Add-in**:
   - Go to the Home tab.
   - Click the PowerPoint AI ChatBot button to open the task pane.

## Testing the Add-in
1. **Run the Add-in**:
   - Click "Search Slides" in the task pane.
